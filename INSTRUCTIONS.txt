The challenge consists in dealing with a regression problem using a parametric and a nonparametric approach.
In particular,  the former will consist in estimating a linear regression model for the train data contained
in the train_ch.csv.
The latter will consist in using KNN (properly tuned) to predict the response values for the test observations
(please use FNN library).

Your task is to use the  training data to build your models and to test them on the test_ch.csv observations.
You will receive a training set (train_ch.csv) of 1000 observations and a test set (test_ch.csv) of 100,
with nine independent variables.


Your submission will consist of a zip file StudentRegistrationNumber_FamilyName.zip containing the following files:
1. A csv file containing: two numeric columns named pred_knn and pred_lm, one for each method, containing the 100
predicted values for the test data.
2. A presentation in PDF with up to 6 pages, in which you describe your analysis, how you obtained and evaluated
 the model.
3. The R macro named solution.R used to obtain the results.
